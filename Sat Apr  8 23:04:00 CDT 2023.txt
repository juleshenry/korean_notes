I remember asking a similar question when I moved here and it got downvoted into oblivion for some reason. It's a totally valid question and it is really hard to find specific information like this when you first start out learning!

몇 세트 남았어요? How many sets do you have left?

(저는 ~ 할 건데) 좀 보조 해주실 수 있나요? (I'm going to do a ...) Can you spot me?

아직 쓰시고 있나요? Are you still using this?

기구 seems to be used rather than 기계 for machine, but people also will just say 머신

헬창 is a very popular word that essentially means gym rat that people who work out like to throw around a lot, using it as a sort of compliment in a fun way. Though I know for people not into working out, the word sounds kind of impolite or crude (it essentially is an abbreviation for like "health whore") so I'd just use it at the gym.

빵빵하다 is used to describe big muscles. 근육이 빵빵!

체지방 means bodyfat. 체중 means (body)weight. 끼 is a counter for meals, so people might ask you questions like 하루에 몇 끼 먹나요? or How many meals do you eat a day?

오운완 or ㅇㅇㅇ is something you'll see often on social media that just means 오늘도 운동 완료했다, or I finished my workout for today
